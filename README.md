## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This%20starter%20configures%20Supabase%20Auth%20to%20use%20cookies%2C%20making%20the%20user's%20session%20available%20throughout%20the%20entire%20Next.js%20app%20-%20Client%20Components%2C%20Server%20Components%2C%20Route%20Handlers%2C%20Server%20Actions%20and%20Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png&integration-ids=oac_VqOgBHqhEoFTPzGkPd7L0iH6)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app -e with-supabase
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd name-of-new-app
   ```

4. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.

# DOCUMENTATION:

## Supabase

### common commands

- start:
  npx supabase start

- stop:
  npx supabase stop
  docker ps -q | ForEach-Object { docker stop $\_ }
  docker rm $(docker ps -aq -f status=exited -f name=performance-review)

#### pull db changes

- Pull schema changes from remote database: https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-db-reset

```
npx supabase db reset
```

#### db migration

```
npx supabase migration up
```

##### Seed db

- Step 1

Go to the [Authentication tab in the Supabase Dashboard](http://localhost:54323/project/default/auth/users) and create a new test user. This will trigger the creation of an App user as well.

```
fer@devlights.com
cyn@devlights.com
12345678
```

- Step 1.1

If desired, update the newly created 'app_user' full name to have meaningful data, e.g. TestLast, TestFirst.

```
Cyn Stefani
Fer Lujan
```

- Step 2

In the [Supabase Dashboard](http://localhost:54323/project/default/editor), add the role 'reviewer' to your user in the 'user_role' intermediate table.

- Step 3

Add an entry in the 'reviewer_reviewee' intermediate table, with your user as the reviewer and the newly created user as the reviewee.

- Step 4

Create a new 'user_review' and select the active 'review', with your user as the reviewer and the new test user as the reviewee.

- Step 5

Open the Next app and go to the 'Mis Evaluados' tab. You will see your reviewee. Click 'Comenzar Evaluacion' to complete their review.

- Step 6

To add reviewee answers to each created answer, access the Supabase dashboard and manually edit the rows.

- Step 7

To see the feedback, manually update the 'user_review' table in the dashboard and set both completed columns to true. You can access the feedback from the 'Mis Evaluados' page.
